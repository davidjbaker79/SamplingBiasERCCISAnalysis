# SamplingBiasERCCISAnalysis

This code evaluates spatial, temporal, and taxonomic variations in the sampling of local biodiversity at fine spatial scales and makes use of 60 years of species records to estimate trends in sampling completeness over time at spatial grains of between 64 and 1 km2 for 15 species groups and model the socio-environmental drivers of this variation.
